# Machine Learning Studies

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning and experimenting with **Machine Learning**!  
Here, you’ll find a series of projects numbered to reflect increasing complexity and incremental progress in my studies.  
Each project includes documentation and explanations to demonstrate what I’ve learned and how I approached each challenge.

## Goals

- **Develop ML Skills**: By starting with simpler tasks and datasets, I am gradually tackling more complex problems.  
- **Document Learning**: Every project includes explanatory comments and docstrings describing the methodology.  
- **Show Progress**: Project numbering indicates the evolution of my skills, from basic to more advanced techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Numbered Folders**: Each folder (`01_`, `02_`, `03_`, …) contains one or more machine learning experiments or prototypes.
- **Explanatory Scripts**: Code files have thorough docstrings that explain data loading, model training, and evaluation steps.
- **Incremental Complexity**: As folder numbers increase, so does the complexity of tasks, datasets, and algorithms involved.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alac1984/machine_learning.git
   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**  
   If a `requirements.txt` is available, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Otherwise, make sure to install the necessary libraries used in the projects:
   - `pandas`
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `xgboost`
   - `charset-normalizer`

4. **Explore a Project**  
   Navigate to one of the numbered folders (e.g., `01_iris_diabetes`) and run:
   ```bash
   python iris.py
   ```
   Feel free to examine or run the other scripts to see how each approach differs and progresses.

## Next Steps

- **Additional Techniques**: Explore advanced machine learning methods, including hyperparameter tuning and deep learning.
- **New Datasets**: Continue experimenting with larger or more diverse datasets for broader exposure.
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Expand docstrings and notebooks to include more visualizations and explanatory text.

## Feedback & Contributions

If you have suggestions, spot issues, or wish to share improvements:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your proposed changes.
3. Open a pull request describing your work.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope these projects offer insight into my journey through Machine Learning. Feel free to reach out or open an issue for further discussion!
